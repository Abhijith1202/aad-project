# Chapter 1 : The beginning

## 1.1 What _is_ an algorithm
Say you are on a road trip with your friends, somewhere far far away. Your goal is simple: get to the destination safely. Now you are pretty sure you are lost, so you decide to open your window and ask a bystander for the way to your destination (lets just say you had no reception for your google maps). The guy tells you which path to go in, what turns to make, quite often with some landmarks to ensure you get it right. You follow whatever <i>instructions</i> he gave you, and arrive at your destination, safe and sound, thus, fulfilling your goal.

Now lets think about this from a different approach. Your goal (problem at hand) was to reach the destination. You were given the instructions (rules) to follow to reach the destination. Finally, you reach the destination (problem solved!). This is what an <i>algorithm</i> is.

In short, an algorithms is a set of rules or instructions to be followed for doing a calculation, or solving a problem. Here, the instructions given by the bystander is the algorithm: not following this, or even changing the order of these instruction may lead to you not reaching the destination. 

## 1.2 How to compare algorithms
<p>Taking the same example of giving directions, suppose there are two routes leading to your destination: one being longer than the other. Keep in mind that the shorted route and the longer route have a different set of instructions, or, as we formally defined, algorithms. Usually, we prefer to take the shortest route to the destination. But it is also possible that the longer route is more well-built. Thus, if we are in a hurry, we might choose the shorter one, but those who value comfort over speed would prefer the longer route.
