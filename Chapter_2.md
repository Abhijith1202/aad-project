# Chapter 2 : Compression

## 2.1 What is compression
Let us continue with our example: the road trip. There are two bystanders to which you can ask the route- one is a prodigy and tells each of the multiple routes to your destination, and another knows the best/shortest route to the destination. Obviously, any normal person will get confused on hearing the entire lists of route he can take, and will probably end up getting lost again. The other guy, on the other hand, suggests the best route, and hence, is more often the preferred choice, as he too has decided the optimum route after considering all the routes.

Irrespective of who gives us the route, we generally choose the best route of the mentioned ones, and thus, the two bystanders effectively convey the same information. Thus, bystander 2 has conveyed the same information as bystander 1, while talking less (or consuming less of our memory space, lets say). In short, route by bystander 2 is the *compressed* form of whatever bystander 1 said.

Consider another example: the reader probably knows, and prefers the use of Ï€ as 3.14, and not as 3.14159265358... , and speed of light as 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s, and not 299792458 m/s. Formally, **compression refers to conversion (of data, a data file, or a communications signal) in order to reduce the space occupied or bandwidth required**. Compression is normally used to reduce the size of data/file without removing information.

With the advent of technology, more and more exchange and storage of data came to be, and as storage of this data is somewhat costly, the search for better and better ways of compression began to be carried out. This search branched out into different fields, such as data compression, signal compresson etc, and hence, compression is now a very vast, disjoint branch.

Recall from chapter 1 that there are different algorithm paradigms (commonly used approach in designing algorithms). The goal of compression is one: to *compress* the data/file, ie, to reduce the space taken by it, and since it is not a way of designing an algorithm, compression is not a paradigm. Rather, it is a different field in computer science. The different algorithms used for different kinds of compression use different algorithm paradigms like the ones mentioned in chapter 1.

## 2.2 Why compression
As mentioned above, the need of compression is quite obvious
    - To save *space* while storing data
    - To save *time* while transmitting it
    - Most files have a lot of redundant content, and hence, if these can be "comdensed" into a simple representation (lets call it a black box) then it is much easier to store as well as understand.

For example, we know that a movie (1080p) takes around 2gb (not considering bluray). But an uncomressed 1080p 8-bit video requires about 10gb *per minute*. This means that an average movie will take up 1200gb, ie, more than 1TB space. Similarly, the pictures we save in our galleries (jpg or png) are compressed, and not actually the RAW files, which takes up a lot more space. In the modern era, where facetime, skype and other video conferencing is now more preferred than a phonecall, compression is extremely important.

## 2.3 Some terminologies used in compression
### 2.3.1 Self information
This was a term coined by Shannon. Suppose we have an event A whose probability of occurence is P(A). Then, _Self information_ of A is given by <br>
> i(A) = - log<sub>b</sub>P(A)

where b can be 2 (unit is bits), e (unit is nats) or 10 (unit is hartleys). In general, we take b as 2.
